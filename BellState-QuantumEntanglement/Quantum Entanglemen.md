Quantum Physics has given us the Theory of Entanglement, which in quantum mechanics can be connected with the Bell State (Quantum Entanglement), that can be mathematically represented by the formula:

$\mathbf{\mathbf{}{\color{Green} |\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)}}$$

This phenomenon allows distant particles to interact instantaneously, challenging classical notions of space and time.
