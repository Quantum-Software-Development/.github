## <p align="center">  Step into the Future, with Circuits and Qubits 

<br>

Quantum computing is a technology that uses the properties of quantum physics to overcome the limitations of conventional bits. While a bit is binary, restricted to zero and one, a qubit can represent several combinations of zero and one at the same time. This is possible thanks to the quantum property called superposition.

The evolution of quantum computing promises to revolutionize the way we perform complex tasks. Imagine a future in which problems that today would take years to be solved could be solved in a matter of minutes or seconds! There is still much to be discovered and developed in the field of quantum computing, but it is certain that this technology has the potential to change the world as we know it.

## [Quantum Computers: What Are They?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing)

Quantum computers are becoming the next frontiers demonstrating capabilities a traditional computer cannot solve.

Ever wondered how the term â€˜quantumâ€™ came into existence?

Quantum computing certainly works under the principle of quantum physics perform rapid calculations using qubits and quantum bits. A total contrast of what is present in the current traditional computers. A traditional classical computer works on classical physics and performs calculations using bits of all we know. But on the other hand, quantum computers can make calculations in split seconds. Wherein in the case of a classical computer, it may take tens of thousands of years to even perform such calculations.

From drug development to weather forecasts and stock trades, quantum computers will revolutionize everything. Therefore, it should not come as a surprise as to why the world is racing to build its first quantum computer.

Promises around quantum computing making strides in the medical field. As a result, it can enable AI specialists and AI professionals working in the field to gain maximum benefit from the technology


## [Whatâ€™s Quantum Data ?](https://thequantuminsider.com/2022/08/23/quantum-computer-ai-powering-computers-with-quantum-brains/)

It is also referred to as any type of data that can occur in both a natural and an artificial quantum system. Such data can be easily gathered or generated using quantum computers. The quantum data is said to exhibit entanglement and superposition that may lead to joining probable distributions. These distributions can further require an extensive amount of classical computational resources for storing purposes.


## [AI Quantum Programming Language](https://thequantuminsider.com/2022/08/23/quantum-computer-ai-powering-computers-with-quantum-brains/)

- Qiskit â€” an open-source library useful to quantum computers. Qiskit provides tools to create and manipulate quantum programs while running them on devices (prototyped). It functions by creating a quantum neural network using a parameterized quantum circuit through a hidden layer for the neural network.

- Pennylane â€” a library written in Python and can be easily integrated with Qiskit. This tool helps perform parameter-shift amidst gradient descent optimization which leads to quantum gradient descent.

 
## [Whatâ€™s a Hybrid Quantum-classical Model?](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum)

A hybrid quantum-classical model represents and generalizes data using the quantum mechanical origin. This is because, in the near term, most quantum processors are more likely to remain noisy and small, thus making it difficult for quantum models to generalize quantum data using just the quantum processor.

To remain effective, NISQ processors need to closely work with classical co-processors.


## [Quantum Machine Learning Services](https://qiskit.org/learn/course/machine-learning-course)

There are multiple services available, two of which the tech giants themselves provide (Google and IBM).

- Forest â€” this service is offered by Rigetti Computing. This tool suite includes development tools and programming languages.

- Xanadu â€” is a hardware-based cloud started by a Canadian startup. This processor can handle 8-, 12, and 24-qubit chips.

- IBM Q Experience â€” an online platform that allows its users from the general public access to a certain set of IBMâ€™s prototype quantum processor using the Cloud.


## [For Reflection](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/01/06/1066317/whats-next-for-quantum-computing/)

Despite being at a nascent stage, quantum computing managed to make a buzz in the industry. Solving the impossible within seconds is what quantum computing promises the world.
