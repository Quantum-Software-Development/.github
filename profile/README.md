# [Predecessors]() of Quantum Mechanics <br>

### 1. [Leonhard Euler]() (1748) <br> ────────────── 

Leonhard Euler, one of the most significant mathematicians in history, contributed foundational mathematical principles that would later support the development of quantum mechanics. His work in functions and complex numbers laid the groundwork for modern physics.

   * Developed the [Euler's Formula](), which links exponential functions to trigonometric functions. It is fundamental in wave mechanics and quantum state representation.  
   
   ### ***Euler's Formula:***
     
   $\huge \color{DeepSkyBlue} e^{i\theta}$ = $\huge \color{DeepSkyBlue} \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)$

  <br>

   [Where]():  
     - $\large \color{DeepSkyBlue} \ e \$: Base of the natural logarithm.  
     - $\large \color{DeepSkyBlue} \ \theta \$: Phase angle.  
     - $\large \color{DeepSkyBlue} \ i \$: Imaginary unit.  

   Euler's formula is essential for describing [quantum wavefunctions]() and [visualizing oscillations]() in the complex plane.

#

### 2. [Carl Friedrich Gauss]() (1809) <br>  ──────────────

Carl Friedrich Gauss was pivotal in developing the mathematical framework used in quantum mechanics. His work on number theory and statistics influenced quantum field theory and the statistical interpretation of quantum systems.

   * Introduced the [Gaussian Distribution](), which describes random variables and noise in quantum systems.  
  
   ### ***Gaussian Distribution Formula:***
     
   $\huge \color{DeepSkyBlue} f(x)$ =   $\huge \color{DeepSkyBlue} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$

   <br>

   [Where]():  
     - $\large \color{DeepSkyBlue} \ \mu \$: Mean of the distribution.  
     - $\large \color{DeepSkyBlue} \ \sigma \$: Standard deviation.  
     - $\large \color{DeepSkyBlue} \ x \$: Random variable.  

   This formula is widely used to [model measurement uncertainties]() in quantum mechanics.

#
 
### 3. [Joseph Fourier]() (1822)  <br>  ──────────────

Joseph Fourier’s development of Fourier analysis allowed quantum mechanics to describe wave functions in terms of frequency components. His work directly relates to the development of quantum mechanics in wave propagation.

  * Developed the mathematical framework for the Fourier Transform, which is foundational in quantum mechanics and quantum computing.  

  ### ***Formula for Fourier Transform:***
  
  $\huge \color{DeepSkyBlue} \hat{f}(k)$ =  $\huge \color{DeepSkyBlue} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \, e^{-2\pi i k x} \, dx$

<br>

   ### ***Formula for [Inverse]() Fourier Transform:***
  
   $\huge \color{DeepSkyBlue} f(x)$ = $\huge \color{DeepSkyBlue} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(k) \, e^{2\pi i k x} \, dk$

   <br>

  [Where]():  
  - $\large \color{DeepSkyBlue} f(x)$ is the original function in the spatial domain.  
  - $\large \color{DeepSkyBlue} \hat{f}(k)$ is the transformed function in the frequency domain.  
  - $\large \color{DeepSkyBlue} x$ represents position, and $\large \color{DeepSkyBlue} k$ represents momentum or frequency.

     
 **Relevance in** Quantum Mechanics and Computing: 
   - **Quantum Mechanics**: Converts wave functions between position and momentum spaces.  
   - **Quantum Computing**: Basis for the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), essential for algorithms like Shor's factoring algorithm.

   * Srinivasa Ramanujan made groundbreaking contributions to mathematics, particularly in the realms of modular forms and infinite series. His work has had a lasting impact on various fields, including quantum gravity and string theory.

 ### ***Ramanujan's Infinite Series for*** $\huge \color{DeepSkyBlue} {\pi}$:

One of his most famous formulas is an infinite series for $\huge \color{DeepSkyBlue} \frac{1}{\pi}$:

$\huge \color{DeepSkyBlue} \frac{1}{\pi}$ = $\huge \color{DeepSkyBlue} \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{9801} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(4n)!(1103 + 26390n)}{(n!)^4 396^{4n}}$

<br>

[Where]():
<!-- - $\large \color{DeepSkyBlue} \ n \$ : Summation index.-->
- $\large \color{DeepSkyBlue} \ n \$: Summation index.




This series converges extraordinarily rapidly, making it highly efficient for calculating $\large \color{DeepSkyBlue} \frac{1}{\pi} \( \pi \)$ to many decimal places. In 1985, William Gosper used this formula to compute $\large \color{DeepSkyBlue} \frac{1}{\pi} \( \pi \)$ to 17 million digits. 

Ramanujan's deep insights into infinite series and modular forms continue to influence modern mathematical research and applications.

   * Co-developed the [Bose-Einstein Condensate](https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/satyendra-nath-bose-and-his-contributions-to-the-quantum-world/), describing particles that share quantum states.
  
  ### ***Bose-Einstein Distribution Formula:***  
  
   $\huge \color{DeepSkyBlue} f(E) = \frac{1}{e^{(E-\mu)/k_B T} - 1}$  

   <br>

   [Where]():

 ──────────────

   * Introduced the concepts of [quantum cryptography]() and [quantum money](), making significant contributions to the development of secure communication systems. Wiesner's work laid the groundwork for the field of quantum cryptography.

   * **Quantum Money [Quantum Currency]()**

   * **BB84 Protocol Formula:**  
     The Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) is used to measure the efficiency and security of the BB84 protocol by determining the [rate of errors]() that occur during the [transmission of quantum bits]() (qubits). It is calculated as follows:

     - [**Total bits sent**]() refers to the total number of qubits transmitted during the key distribution process.
    
      
     This formula is essential for determining the [level of interference and security in quantum communication systems]().

- **$\huge \color{DeepSkyBlue} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$**: This normalization factor is necessary to ensure that the total probability of measuring the system is 1. In quantum mechanics, the norm of the state vector (the sum of the squares of the probabilities of possible outcomes) must equal 1.

The formula above represents a prominent entangled state known as a **Bell state** or **maximally entangled state**, which is essential in quantum computing theory and quantum cryptography, such as in Artur Ekert's protocol.


- **$\large \color{DeepSkyBlue} |\Phi^+\rangle$**: Represents the quantum state vector in Dirac notation (also known as bra-ket notation). The state $|\Phi^+\rangle$ is one of the four Bell states, which are entangled qubit states.

- **$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$**: This normalization factor is necessary to ensure that the total probability of measuring the system is 1. In quantum mechanics, the norm of the state vector (the sum of the squares of the probabilities of possible outcomes) must equal 1.

- **$|00\rangle$ and $|11\rangle$**: These are the states of the two qubits. The symbol $|00\rangle$ denotes both qubits in the "0" state, and $|11\rangle$ denotes both qubits in the "1" state.

- **$+$**: The sum between $|00\rangle$ and $|11\rangle$ indicates that the system is in a superposition of these two states. The Bell state is not a classical state where the system would be either 00 or 11, but rather a superposition of both. This means that when the qubits are measured, they will both have the same value (either both 0 or both 1), but the measurement is probabilistic until the observation occurs.

This state is an example of **quantum entanglement**. Entanglement is a phenomenon where two particles (or qubits, in the case of quantum computing) are correlated in such a way that the state of one particle (qubit) instantaneously affects the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them.

In [quantum cryptography](), this state is used to ensure the security of communications because any attempt to intercept the entangled qubits alters their state, which can be detected by the person sending the message.
