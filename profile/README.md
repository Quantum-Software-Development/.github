## <p align="center"> ðŸ›° Step into the Future, with Circuits and Qubits 

<br>

Quantum computing is a technology that uses the properties of quantum physics to overcome the limitations of conventional bits. While a bit is binary, restricted to zero and one, a qubit can represent several combinations of zero and one at the same time. This is possible thanks to the quantum property called superposition.

The evolution of quantum computing promises to revolutionize the way we perform complex tasks. Imagine a future in which problems that today would take years to be solved could be solved in a matter of minutes or seconds! There is still much to be discovered and developed in the field of quantum computing, but it is certain that this technology has the potential to change the world as we know it.

## [Quantum Computers](https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing): What Are They?

Quantum computers are becoming the next frontiers demonstrating capabilities a traditional computer cannot solve.

Ever wondered how the term â€˜quantumâ€™ came into existence?

Quantum computing certainly works under the principle of quantum physics perform rapid calculations using qubits and quantum bits. A total contrast of what is present in the current traditional computers. A traditional classical computer works on classical physics and performs calculations using bits of all we know. But on the other hand, quantum computers can make calculations in split seconds. Wherein in the case of a classical computer, it may take tens of thousands of years to even perform such calculations.

From drug development to weather forecasts and stock trades, quantum computers will revolutionize everything. Therefore, it should not come as a surprise as to why the world is racing to build its first quantum computer.

Promises around quantum computing making strides in the medical field. As a result, it can enable AI specialists and AI professionals working in the field to gain maximum benefit from the technology
