# <p align="center"> âš›ï¸Ž Welcome to The New Era, Welcome To Quantum !<br>

<br>

<p align="center"> Welcome to the Future, with Circuits and Qubits ðŸš€


In this post, Iâ€™m excited to share the code I used to create my first circuits and qubits using the IBM Quantum platform.
The code is designed to create a quantum circuit with four quantum registers and four classical registers. It applies a variety of quantum gates such as Hadamard, CNOT, and Toffoli gates to the quantum registers and measures them to the classical registers. The circuit is then visualized using the CircuitComposer widget from IBM Quantum.
IBM is at the forefront with its quantum computing laboratory, developing technologies that will revolutionize our understanding of computing. With quantum computing, weâ€™re able to tackle problems that would be insurmountable for classical computers. âš›ï¸Ž
Weâ€™re stepping into a New Era, and Iâ€™m eager to see where this journey will lead usâ€¦

## [Quantum Computers](https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing): What Are They?

Quantum computers are becoming the next frontiers demonstrating capabilities a traditional computer cannot solve.

Ever wondered how the term â€˜quantumâ€™ came into existence?

Quantum computing certainly works under the principle of quantum physics perform rapid calculations using qubits and quantum bits. A total contrast of what is present in the current traditional computers. A traditional classical computer works on classical physics and performs calculations using bits of all we know. But on the other hand, quantum computers can make calculations in split seconds. Wherein in the case of a classical computer, it may take tens of thousands of years to even perform such calculations.

From drug development to weather forecasts and stock trades, quantum computers will revolutionize everything. Therefore, it should not come as a surprise as to why the world is racing to build its first quantum computer.

Promises around quantum computing making strides in the medical field. As a result, it can enable AI specialists and AI professionals working in the field to gain maximum benefit from the technology

## Whatâ€™s [Quantum Data](https://thequantuminsider.com/2022/08/23/quantum-computer-ai-powering-computers-with-quantum-brains/)?

It is also referred to as any type of data that can occur in both a natural and an artificial quantum system. Such data can be easily gathered or generated using quantum computers. The quantum data is said to exhibit entanglement and superposition that may lead to joining probable distributions. These distributions can further require an extensive amount of classical computational resources for storing purposes.

## [AI Quantum Programming Language](https://thequantuminsider.com/2022/08/23/quantum-computer-ai-powering-computers-with-quantum-brains/) Involved in Quantum Computing

- Pennylane â€” a library written in Python and can be easily integrated with Qiskit. This tool helps perform parameter-shift amidst gradient descent optimization which leads to quantum gradient descent.

- Qiskit â€” an open-source library useful to quantum computers. Qiskit provides tools to create and manipulate quantum programs while running them on devices (prototyped). It functions by creating a quantum neural network using a parameterized quantum circuit through a hidden layer for the neural network.
  

## Whatâ€™s a Hybrid Quantum-classical Model?

A hybrid quantum-classical model represents and generalizes data using the quantum mechanical origin. This is because, in the near term, most quantum processors are more likely to remain noisy and small, thus making it difficult for quantum models to generalize quantum data using just the quantum processor.

To remain effective, NISQ processors need to closely work with classical co-processors.



## [Quantum Machine Learning Services](https://qiskit.org/learn/course/machine-learning-course)

There are multiple services available, two of which the tech giants themselves provide (Google and IBM).

- Forest â€” this service is offered by Rigetti Computing. This tool suite includes development tools and programming languages.

- Xanadu â€” is a hardware-based cloud started by a Canadian startup. This processor can handle 8-, 12, and 24-qubit chips.

- IBM Q Experience â€” an online platform that allows its users from the general public access to a certain set of IBMâ€™s prototype quantum processor using the Cloud.



## In Brief

Despite being at a nascent stage, quantum computing managed to make a buzz in the industry. Solving the impossible within seconds is what quantum computing promises the world.
