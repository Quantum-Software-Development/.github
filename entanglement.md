#### Key Concepts  

Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the state of the other(s), regardless of the distance separating them. This unique connection arises when particles interact and share a quantum state.


Key principles of entanglement include:  

1. **Nonlocality**: Changes to the quantum state of one entangled particle instantaneously affect its partner(s), even when separated by vast distances.  
2. **Superposition**: Entangled particles exist in a combination of states until measured, at which point their states are correlated.  
3. **Quantum Correlations**: Measurements of entangled particles reveal patterns that defy classical explanations, demonstrating the peculiarities of quantum theory.
4. Entanglement is described mathematically using the concept of a **shared wavefunction**, which represents the combined quantum state of the entangled system.  


#### Importance  
Quantum entanglement is a cornerstone of modern quantum technologies and holds significant implications for both theoretical physics and practical applications:
