#### Key Concepts  
Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the state of the other(s), regardless of the distance separating them. This unique connection arises when particles interact and share a quantum state.
